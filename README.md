# Software Testing and Automation Portfolio

This repository contains artifacts from my coursework in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The included projects demonstrate my skills in creating unit tests, analyzing testing approaches, and implementing effective testing strategies based on requirements.

## Portfolio Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring functionality and security requires a multi-layered approach. First, I implement thorough unit testing to verify that individual components work as expected. As demonstrated in my Contact and ContactService test files, I test both valid cases and edge cases to uncover potential issues. Beyond unit testing, I employ integration testing to confirm components work together correctly. I also follow secure coding practices such as input validation (shown in the Contact class), proper exception handling, and adhering to the principle of least privilege. Regular code reviews and static analysis tools help identify vulnerabilities before deployment, while continuous integration ensures consistent testing with each code change.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs begins with clear requirement gathering and analysis. In the Contact service example, I translated requirements (like contacts needing unique IDs and specific field constraints) into concrete validation rules and test cases. I approach this process by breaking down broad requirements into specific, testable criteria. For any software development, I prioritize understanding the core problem users need to solve rather than just their stated solution. This allows me to implement functionality that truly meets their needs while also anticipating potential edge cases they might not have considered. Continuous feedback loops and iterative development help refine these implementations to better align with user expectations over time.

### How do I approach designing software?

My approach to software design emphasizes modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. As seen in the Contact and ContactService classes, I separate concerns by creating distinct classes with focused responsibilities. I apply object-oriented principles like encapsulation to protect data integrity (private fields with public getters/setters in the Contact class) and design interfaces that are intuitive and consistent. Before writing code, I map out class relationships and data flows to ensure a coherent architecture. I also prioritize forward compatibility by designing components that can adapt to changing requirements with minimal modifications. Throughout the design process, I balance theoretical elegance with practical considerations like performance, security, and the specific context in which the software will operate.

## Included Artifacts

- **Project One**: Contact service implementation (Contact.java, ContactService.java) and corresponding unit tests (ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java)
- **Project Two**: Software testing summary and reflections report

These artifacts showcase my ability to implement robust software testing strategies and my understanding of quality assurance principles in software development.
